# hello-world
Just another repository for the tutorial

This file should talk about me, but I wanted to ignore that to explain what I'm going to do with this account.
I'll do a lot of projects. Most will be private, as I don't like to share my personal work around.
Some projects or snippets will be public, and probably I'll leave the license as free as possible, so if you see something you want to use, feel free to.
